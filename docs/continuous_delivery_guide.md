# Continuous Delivery Setup for a Sinatra App with Docker and GitHub Actions

This guide demonstrates how to containerize a Ruby Sinatra project and set up continuous delivery using Docker and GitHub Actions. We will create separate Docker configurations for development (with hot-reloading) and production, manage environment variables securely with Dotenv, and configure a CI workflow to build and push the Docker image to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) on each push to the main branch. Weâ€™ll also update the Makefile with convenient commands. The goal is a smooth development experience and an automated delivery pipeline following best practices.

## Dockerfile for Development (Hot-Reloading with Rerun)

For the development environment, we'll use a Dockerfile that sets up the Sinatra app with all dependencies and enables hot-reloading. Sinatraâ€™s recommended approach for reloading code in development is to run the app via an external file-watcher tool like `rerun`, which restarts the app when files change.

### `Dockerfile.dev` (development Dockerfile)

```Dockerfile
# Use an official lightweight Ruby image for development
FROM ruby:3.2-slim

# Install build tools and SQLite library (needed to install the sqlite3 gem)
RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y build-essential libsqlite3-dev

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install app dependencies (Gemfile should list all gems)
COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
RUN gem install bundler && bundle install

# Install 'rerun' for auto-reloading in development
RUN gem install rerun

# Copy the application code
COPY . .

# Expose Sinatra's default port
EXPOSE 4567

# Set environment to development by default
ENV RACK_ENV=development

# Command: use rerun to restart the app on code changes
CMD ["rerun", "--", "ruby", "app.rb", "-o", "0.0.0.0"]
```

### Key points:
- We start from a Ruby base image and install any needed system libraries (like `libsqlite3-dev` for the `sqlite3` gem).
- We install `rerun` so the container can automatically reload on file changes.
- `RACK_ENV=development` ensures Sinatra runs in development mode.
- Changes to code are reflected without rebuilding the container each time.

## Dockerfile for Production (Optimized for Deployment)

We create a separate Dockerfile focused on a slim, secure image. This uses multi-stage builds to reduce image size.

### `Dockerfile` (production Dockerfile)

```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Builder â€“ install gems and assets
FROM ruby:3.2-slim AS builder

# Install build tools and dependencies for building gems
RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y build-essential libsqlite3-dev

WORKDIR /app

# Install app gems (without dev and test groups for a leaner production image)
COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
RUN gem install bundler && bundle install --without development test

# Copy application source code
COPY . .

# Stage 2: Final image â€“ only includes runtime necessities
FROM ruby:3.2-slim

# Install runtime dependencies (no build tools)
RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y libsqlite3-0 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /app

# Copy app code and gem bundles from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app . 
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/bundle /usr/local/bundle

# Set environment to production
ENV RACK_ENV=production

# Expose port
EXPOSE 4567

# Use an appropriate command to run the Sinatra app in production
CMD ["bundle", "exec", "ruby", "app.rb", "-o", "0.0.0.0", "-p", "4567"]
```

### Key optimizations and practices:
- Slim base image + runtime-only packages.
- Multi-stage builds exclude dev tools from the final image.
- `bundle exec` with array form for proper signal handling.

## Docker Compose for Development vs Production

### `docker-compose.dev.yml` (Local Development)

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: . 
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports:
      - "4567:4567"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    env_file:
      - .env.development
    environment:
      - RACK_ENV=development
```

### `docker-compose.prod.yml` (Production/Deployment)

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/<GHCR_USERNAME>/sinatra-app:latest
    env_file:
      - .env
    ports:
      - "4567:4567"
    volumes:
      - sinatra_data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  sinatra_data:
```

## Managing Environment Variables Securely with Dotenv

### Setup

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'dotenv'
```

Then run:

```bash
bundle install
```

### In `app.rb`:

```ruby
require 'dotenv/load'
require 'sinatra'

configure do
  enable :sessions
  set :session_secret, ENV['SESSION_SECRET']
end
```

### Example `.env.development`

```bash
DATABASE_PATH=DB_path
SESSION_SECRET=dev-secret-key
WEATHERBIT_API_KEY=your_dev_api_key
```

> ðŸ”’ Do **not** commit `.env` files. Add them to `.gitignore`.

## GitHub Actions Workflow for Continuous Delivery

### `.github/workflows/continuous_delivery.yml`

```yaml
name: Continuous Delivery

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

      - name: Log in to GHCR
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ secrets.GHCR_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GHCR_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v3
        with:
          context: .
          file: Dockerfile
          push: true
          tags: |
            ghcr.io/${{ secrets.GHCR_USERNAME }}/sinatra-app:latest
            ghcr.io/${{ secrets.GHCR_USERNAME }}/sinatra-app:${{ github.sha }}
          cache-from: type=gha
          cache-to: type=gha,mode=max

  
```

## Makefile Updates for Docker Commands

```Makefile
# Bring up the development environment (build image and start containers)
docker-dev-up:
	docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build

# Build the production image (similar to what CI does), tagging it for local use
docker-prod-build:
	docker build -f Dockerfile -t sinatra-app:local .

# Run tests inside the development container (if you have a test suite)
docker-test:
	docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml run --rm app bundle exec rspec



## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Environment variables & secrets**: Keep `.env` files out of version control. Use GitHub Secrets in CI.
- **Caching**: Use Docker layer caching in Dockerfiles and GitHub Actions to speed up builds.
- **Image tagging**: Tag with `latest` for deployments and commit SHAs for traceability.
- **Security**: Use non-root user in production Dockerfile (optional hardening).
- **Logging & monitoring**: Capture logs and add health checks to containers.
- **Testing**: Run tests in CI before building and deploying images.

By following this setup, you ensure a clear separation between development and production, use secure config management, and implement an automated delivery pipeline from source to deployment.
