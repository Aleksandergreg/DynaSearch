# Detecting Agile BS

We have reviewed the following questions halfway through the project on April 1st.

### Are teams delivering working software to at least some subset of real users every iteration (including the first) and gathering feedback? (alt: every two weeks)

- The only feedback we receive is from Anders, but there are no real users, so in some ways, we can answer yes to this question, because we implement all the features he suggests, and corrects bugs that he point out to us.
- But we don’t have an implemented system for gathering feedback from users. We could set up some logging from the website to detect how users interact, or have some ways for users to report issues or suggestions.

### Is there a product charter that lays out the mission and strategic goals? Do all members of the team understand both, and are they able to see how their work contributes to both?

- We don’t have a mission or strategic goals, since the assignment has been clearly defined for us from the beginning of the project.
- We could make a meta definition of mission and strategy using a product charter template, of what we wish to accomplish with the final exam project, or pretend that we are a real company with a mission to make an improved search engine. The approach depends on how much roleplaying the project requires, which is difficult for us to define by ourselves.
- We can argue for our teacher is the PO and gives us mandatory tasks but also nice to haves. Therefore you may argument for there’s a clear mission.

### Is feedback from users turned into concrete work items for sprint teams on timelines shorter than one month?

- Yes, every feedback is turned into issues on our GitHub Projects board and implemented within a month.

### Are teams empowered to change the requirements based on user feedback?

- Yes, we are a small team without a hierarchy structure, so we have autonomy to discuss and change the requirements. Also, we are in a learning environment, where the overall objective is to learn and improve our skills, so we are actively trying to encourage each other to ask questions and critically review ours and each other’s work. We are actively trying to implement a working environment with a high level of psychological safety for everyone.

### Are teams empowered to change their process based on what they learn?

- Yes, we are empowered to change the processes based on what we learn.
    
    When the team identifies better ways of handling processes we inspire/expect change!
    

### Is the full ecosystem of your project agile? (Agile programming teams followed by linear, bureaucratic deployment is a failure.)

- Currently no! We aspire to increase some of our processes to be more agile, especially continuous deployment. Which we expect to be able to fulfill in the near future. But even with continuous deployment acquired we are highly sceptical that we’ll ever meet the requirements for a full ecosystem of agile.
