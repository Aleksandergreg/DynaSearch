# .rubocop.yml
# This file configures RuboCop, the Ruby static code analyzer.
# DeepSource typically respects rules configured here.

# Global settings for all cops
AllCops:
  # Enable newer cops included in the RuboCop version being used
  NewCops: enable
  # Exclude common directories from analysis
  Exclude:
    - 'vendor/**/*'      # Ignore third-party code managed by Bundler
    - 'db/schema.rb'   # Often excluded as it's auto-generated
    - 'bin/*'          # Standard directory for executables/setup scripts
    - 'node_modules/**/*' # If using Node.js dependencies

# --- Rule-Specific Configuration ---

# Disable the rule that prefers 'assert_not' over 'refute'.
# We need 'refute' for compatibility with the current Minitest environment.
Minitest/RefuteInsteadOfAssertNot:
  Enabled: false

# Add any other specific RuboCop configurations below as needed
# Example:
# Style/StringLiterals:
#   EnforcedStyle: double_quotes
