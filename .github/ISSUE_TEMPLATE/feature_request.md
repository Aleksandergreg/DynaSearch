### INVEST Principle
_I: Independent, N: Negotiable, V: Valuable, E: Estimable, S: Small, T: Testable_

- **Independent:** Does this issue stand on its own, or is it dependent on others?
- **Negotiable:** Can we iterate on this with the team or stakeholders if needed?
- **Valuable:** Does it provide clear value to the user or the project?
- **Estimable:** Can we estimate the effort required to complete this?
- **Small:** Can this be completed in one sprint/iteration?
- **Testable:** Are the acceptance criteria testable?
